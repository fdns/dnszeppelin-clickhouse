# godnscaptureclickhouse
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fdns/godnscaptureclickhouse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fdns/godnscaptureclickhouse)

A implementation of the library https://github.com/fdns/godnscapture using ClickHouse

## Setting up ClickHouse

You must import the file tables.sql to your ClickHouse database manually. It will create the DNS_LOG table where the data is inserted, and different views with the aggregated data.
You can execute this using docker with the following command

```sh
cat tables.sql | docker run -i -a stdin --rm --net=host yandex/clickhouse-client --multiquery
```

## Example

To run the capturer on eth0

```sh
./gopassivednsclickhouse -serverName localserver -clickhouseAddress localhost:9000 -devName eth0
```
